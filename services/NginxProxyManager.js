/**
 * NGINX Proxy Manager
 *
 * This module is responsible for managing an embedded NGINX proxy
 * that is packaged within the React Native application. The proxy is
 * configured to communicate with the backend via TOR and I2P.
 *
 * Functions:
 *  - initialize(config): Initializes the proxy with a given configuration.
 *  - start(): Starts the NGINX proxy.
 *  - stop(): Stops the NGINX proxy.
 *  - reconfigure(newConfig): Applies new settings to the running proxy.
 *
 * Note: In a production mobile/desktop app, embedding NGINX is unconventional.
 * This is a conceptual implementation.
